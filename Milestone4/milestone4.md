### Improved UI Skeletons from milestone3.md
Our UI skeleton for this milestone is for the Translater-Lyric app. For the last milestone, we presented the UI for the Chat analyzer. 
Our current UI has the feature to translate a song to another language. You enter the original lyrics in the first box, and the translated lyrics in the other. The goal is to have the app tell user if their inputed translation is correct. 

### Our approach to addressing user privacy. 
For our app, we don't see user privacy being a huge issue. All we would really need would be a users log in information and the results retrieved from their interactions with the app (like, translation correctedness, or time spent using the app, etc).
