## Improvement description
We've improved a bit of the visualization by including our logo in the top header. Our interface is easier to navigate with a more clear flow for the steps a user must take to insert a song, find a song, play the game, etc. We've also added a login/create account feature, giving users the ability to play our Game and store their scores. We've included visualization of a user's scores throughtout time. 

## Data visualization
